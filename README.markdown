#Spaced Repetition Flashcard System

This is a spaced repetition flashcard system built using Ruby on Rails. The front-end is designed to work on mobile devices as well as in the web browser on a desktop computer.

The underlying algorithm is based on research into the pshychology of memory. The result is an application that can assist the user with memorisation of large amounts of information with very little time investment.

Potential use cases include language learning, memorisation of abbreviations or technical terms, exam practice, and much more.

To allow the user to monitor their progress statistics are logged and the data can be visualised on the stats page.
