                  <p>Hello and welcome to the myFlashcards Virtual Flashcard System tutorial. Today I am going to be showing you how to use the MyFlashcards Virtual Flashcard System.</p>

                  <p>The first thing that we need to do is register an account and the way we do this is that we go to the top right hand corner of the screen and click the register button. From here we need to enter our registration details which is very simple; it's just an email and a password. You also need to do a password confirmation to make sure you spelt the password correctly.</p>

                  <p>Once you have done that you need to click on the create user button. This will create an account and log you in to the front page. As you can see it says you are logged in as demo@demo.com which is the email address that we specified when we registered.</p>
                  
                  <p>Here are the statistics and at the moment we have no flashcards no reviews, and no new cards, which is to be expected as this is a new account. If you look here it also says that we have no decks created.</p>

                  <p>The next thing we need to do is to create our first deck. This is done by going to the top of the screen and clicking on the manage decks button. From this screen we can create our first deck. This is done by typing in the name of the deck in the text field at the top of the screen. I'm going to call this deck 'Japanese'.</p>

                  <p>Once you have done that you need to click on the create deck button. As you can see, once that is done a message appears at the top of the screen that says............</p>
