Hello and welcome to the myFlashcards Virtual Flashcard System tutorial.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Today I am going to be showing you how to use the MyFlashcards

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Virtual Flashcard System.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The first thing that we need to do is register an account

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and the way we do this is that we go to the top right

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
hand corner of the screen and click the register button.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
From here we need to enter our registration details

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which is very simple; it's just an email and a password.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You also need to do a password confirmation to make sure

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
you spelt the password correctly.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Once you have done that you need to click on the create user button.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This will create an account and log you in to the front page.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
As you can see it says you are logged in as demo@demo.com

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
which is the email address that we specified when we registered.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Here are the statistics and at the moment we have no flashcards

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
no reviews, and no new cards, which is to be expected as this is a new account.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If you look here it also says that we have no decks created.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The next thing we need to do is to create our first deck.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
this is done by going to the top of the screen and clicking on the manage decks button.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
From this screen we can create our first deck.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This is done by typing in the name of the deck in the text field at the top of the screen.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm going to call this deck 'Japanese'.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Once you have done that you need to click on the create deck button.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
As you can see, once that is done a message appears at the top of the screen that says

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
that the deck has been created. We can also see the deck listed in the table below.
